# Network Video Player
Network video player helps you play videos in your mobile phone from your computer, given that both the mobile and the computer are in the same wifi network.


## Installation instructions 
### Step 1 
You should have node.js and npm installed. Checkout Node.js [official installation page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you do not have node.js installed on your computer. Then do the below in a terminal

```javascript
npm i -g network-video-player
```

### Step 2
Install nvb app on your android phone.

### Step 3
Open a terminal and go to the folder you'd like to see the files on.

```javascript
// for example
$ cd ~/Videos
// run nvp
$ nvp
Enter http://192.168.43.177:3333, when app asks!
```

Enter the ip address from the terminal as is in the application. That is it! You should be able to browse the folders and view most of the videos in those folders. Currently 'mpeg4' is viewable.
